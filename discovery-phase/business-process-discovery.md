# Business Process Discovery Framework

## Process Analysis Template

### Process Overview
**Process Name:** [e.g., Customer Onboarding, Order Fulfillment]
**Process Owner:** [Name, Department]
**Scope Boundaries:** [Start trigger → End result]

**Key Metrics:**
- Cycle Time: [Current] → [Target]
- Error Rate: [Current] → [Target]
- Cost per Transaction: [Current] → [Target]
- Customer Satisfaction: [Current] → [Target]

### As-Is Process Mapping

**Process Steps Table:**
| Step | Actor | Action | Input | Output | Time | Pain Points |
|------|-------|--------|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1. | [Role] | [Action] | [Data/Form] | [Result] | [MM] | [Issues] |
| 2. | [Role] | [Action] | [Data/Form] | [Result] | [MM] | [Issues] |
| 3. | [Role] | [Action] | [Data/Form] | [Result] | [MM] | [Issues] |

**Swimlane Visualization:**
Customer → Request → Wait → Review → Accept
Sales Rep → Receive → Validate → → Send
Manager → → → Approve →
System → Log → Notify → Record → Archive

### Pain Point Analysis

**Operational Inefficiencies:**
- Manual data entry between systems
- Multiple approval layers causing delays
- Lack of real-time status visibility
- Inconsistent process execution

**Quality Issues:**
- High error rates in [specific step]
- Customer complaints about [specific issue]
- Rework required in [X]% of cases

**Resource Constraints:**
- Bottleneck at [specific role/step]
- Skill gaps in [specific area]
- System limitations causing workarounds

### Data Flow Analysis

**Information Inputs:**
| Data Element | Source | Format | Frequency | Quality Issues |
|--------------|--------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| [Data] | [System/Form] | [Format] | [Daily/Weekly] | [Problems] |

**Information Outputs:**
| Data Element | Consumer | Format | Timeliness Requirements |
|--------------|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| [Data] | [Team/System] | [Format] | [Real-time/Daily] |

### To-Be Process Design

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- Automate [specific manual step] saving [X] hours weekly
- Eliminate [redundant approval] reducing cycle time by [Y]%
- Implement [validation rule] decreasing errors by [Z]%
- Provide [self-service portal] improving customer satisfaction

**Future State Process Flow:**
Customer → Submit → Track → Complete
System → Validate → Route → Notify
Manager → → Exception Handling →

## Process Workshop Materials

### facilitation Techniques

**Process Mapping Methods:**
- **Sticky Note Storming**: Each participant writes process steps
- **Swimlane Voting**: Group steps into actor lanes
- **Pain Point Dot Voting**: Identify biggest frustrations
- **Idea Clustering**: Group similar improvement ideas

**Visualization Tools:**
- Miro/FigJam for digital collaboration
- Physical whiteboard with color-coded markers
- Pre-printed process templates for quick starts

## Discovery Questions Bank

**Process Understanding:**
- "What triggers this process to start?"
- "What's the very first thing that happens?"
- "What's the final outcome that indicates completion?"
- "What happens when things go wrong?"

**Pain Point Identification:**
- "Where do things most often get stuck?"
- "What information is hardest to get when you need it?"
- "What tasks do you repeat unnecessarily?"
- "Where do you see the most rework?"

**Improvement Opportunities:**
- "If you had a magic wand, what would you change first?"
- "What would make this process 10x faster/better/cheaper?"
- "What do other companies in our industry do better?"
- "What technology could eliminate the hardest parts?"
